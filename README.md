About Saturn I
==============
Saturn I is a board for prototyping low power wireless solutions using OpenTag/DASH7.  It can be used for other purposes as well, but it has a set of features optimized for low-power wireless systems.

Licensing
=========
Saturn I is licensed via the GPLv3.  The schematics and board design files are done in DipTrace, and they are available on GitHub.  OpenTag firmware supports the Saturn I, which is also available on GitHub.  Parties interested in a non-GPL version of the Saturn-I design should contact JP Norair to discuss licensing terms.

Building Saturn I Boards
========================
If you decide to build your own Saturn-I boards and resell them, contact JP Norair in order to get a link to your storefront posted on this page.

Otherwise, you can get Saturn-I boards fully produced, on-demand, by [Tempo Automation](http://www.tempoautomation.com).  Tempo has the design on file and is ready to go, just tell them how many you need.  If you want to stuff your own boards and save money (at the expense of time and frustration), there's a ZIP package in the repository ready to go to [OSHPark](http://www.oshpark.com), as well as the necessary assembly files, drawings, and stencil gerbers.  Saturn-I is not designed to be assembled by hobbyists, so be forewarned, as it uses some very small surface mount components.
